# Alpha Intelligence Engine

## Overview
The Alpha Intelligence Engine is a quantitative framework designed for systematic equity analysis. It implements a Heterogeneous Stacking Ensemble on financial time-series data to isolate and predict alpha, the idiosyncratic return component of asset performance.
